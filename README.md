## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learned how to make a card style webpage using less HTML than what I was used to doing. Also re-touched on the hover option for links. The most important thing I learned while creating this project is that i am getting better and better every day.

- Simple code Im proud of, i just find it really cool the little things one can do with simple code.

```css
main a:hover {
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools css tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - Probably one of the best ways to learn how to do cool things with CSS. There is always something I need to refresh on.
